Datasaurs is a Twitter bot that redraws extinct animals using US cause of death time series data.

Here's the link to the [live bot](https://twitter.com/datasaurs). See my [GitHub](https://github.com/ryantimpe/datasaurs) for the script and latest updates.

## Getting Started

Datasaurs draws an image by replacing the dorsal outline of an extinct animal with a highly correlated cause of death time series.  
Each bot run is randomly generated by sampling 1 of 250 animal images, possibly flipping the drawing's x-values, assigning a random start date to the implied line data series, and filling the chart with a random shade of green.

### Prerequisites

This bot run primarily on R using [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) packages.  
A short Windows batch is scheduled to run every six hours, creating a new post.

### Installing

In addition to the files on the GitHub page, you will need to create [Twitter app](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) and save the credentials to a file API.csv. See the .gitignore files for more information.

## Deployment

The Windows batch file RunDatasaur.bat is two lines telling Windows to run the R script using R 3.4. In future releases, this will be moved to AWS.

## Built With

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - R
* [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) - Tidyverse packages + ggplot2
* [twitteR](https://github.com/geoffjentry/twitteR) - Connect to Twitter through R

## Input data

* Fauna silhoutte png files from [PhyloPic.org](http://phylopic.org/image/browse/). Web addresses and artists for each image used by the bot can be found in BotInputs/DatasaurList.csv.
* United States cause of death data collected from the [CDC Wonder database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html). Queries over various demographics were collected.
