### Introduction

My previous post on [building LEGO mosaics using R](../../../../2018/04/23/lego-mosaic1/) went viral with literally tens of people viewing the page, starring the [GitHub](https://github.com/ryantimpe/LEGOMosaics) repo[^Readme], or sharing their [own creations](https://twitter.com/RaoOfPhysics/status/991724781560107019) on Twitter. [David Smith](https://twitter.com/revodavid) from Microsoft's Revolutions blog even [wrote a post](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/04/lego-sculpture.html) about it.

[^Readme]: Now with a proper README.md file! `r emo::ji("yes")`

In response, I've received a few emails and suggestions for improvements, so I've updated the functions in the repository with some new features.

### Rectangular mosaics

My original goal was to build mosaics that would fit on the standard 48-stud square base plate. Most of the user examples I have seen have used larger dimensions, so I've relaxed the square restriction in the `scale_image()` function.

You can now pass an array of two values to this function, the first value specifying the brick-width of the desired mosaic and the second value specifying the height.

```{r rect, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
readJPEG("LEGOMosaic/goldengirlsW.jpg") %>% 
  scale_image(c(72, 48)) %>% #Single value for square, c(W, H) for rectangle
  legoize() %>% 
  collect_bricks() %>% 
  display_set()
```

```{r rect_show, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# saveRDS(rect_mosaic, "LEGOMosaic/m2_wide.RDS")

readRDS("LEGOMosaic/m2_wide.RDS") %>% display_set("Golden Girls wide mosaic")
```

### Stacked mosaics

The default mosaics are designed to be built by placing a single layer of LEGO plates on a base plate, stud-side up. I received an email from someone who wanted a mosaic that could be built upwards, so the side of the bricks create the image.

This was actually a pretty simple fix. Using `%>% collect_bricks("stacked")` narrows the brick search to just 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, and 2x4 bricks placed horizontally and staggers them - just like laying actual bricks. The charting functions then render the images with a resolution reflecting the proportions of the side of a brick.[^brick_dims]

[^brick_dims]: A 1-unit LEGO brick is [not a square](https://bricks.stackexchange.com/questions/288/what-are-the-dimensions-of-a-lego-brick/295), but is taller than it is wide by a ratio of 6/5.

```{r stacked, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
LEGOmosaic <- readJPEG("LEGOMosaic/goldengirls2.jpg") %>% 
  scale_image(c(72, 48)) %>% 
  legoize() %>% 
  collect_bricks("stacked") 

LEGOmosaic %>% display_set()
```

```{r stacked_show, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# saveRDS(stacked_mosaic, "LEGOMosaic/m2_stacked.RDS")
LEGOmosaic <- readRDS("LEGOMosaic/m2_stacked.RDS") 

LEGOmosaic %>% display_set("Golden Girls stacked mosaic")
```

### Piece list

I've added two new functions to make it easier figure out which LEGO bricks or plates you will need to build the mosaics. The function `table_pieces()` produces a tibble of required pieces for easy printing. 

```{r pieces_table, echo=TRUE}
LEGOmosaic %>% table_pieces() %>% head() %>% knitr::kable()
```

A more fun, graphical alternative is to use `display_pieces()`. This image renders slightly differently between stacked and flat mosaics.

```{r pieces, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
LEGOmosaic %>% display_pieces()
```

On the LEGO [Pick-a-Brick](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Pick-a-Brick) page, you can use the Advanced Search section to filter by each color and select the number of pieces you need.

### The boring parts

I've made a few behind-the-scenes edits for those who use intermediate function output. Each function now returns a list object rather than a data frame. This allows the functions to pass metadata (like the stacked vs flat specification) to other functions.

```{r boring, echo=TRUE}
LEGOmosaic %>% summary() %>% knitr::kable()
```

The `generate_instructions()` function now returns a graphic rather than a data frame, no longer requiring the user to plot them manually.

### Conclusion

These updates to the functions should make the process of creating a LEGO mosaics a bit easier and more accessible. Next time around, I'll build a package.
