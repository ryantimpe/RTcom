Docent at [**Yale Peabody Museum**](http://peabody.yale.edu/) in New Haven, CT since March 2014.
<ul class = "experience">
<li>I lead weekend highlights tours covering the Peabody's dinosaur, mammal, mineral, and Egypt collections. I've written two specialty tours, including one about the Peabody Museum's connection with the [dinosaurs featured in Jurassic Park](../../files/Peabody Jurassic Park Tour - June 2018.pdf).
